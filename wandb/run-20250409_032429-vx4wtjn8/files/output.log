/home/li/anaconda3/envs/LLMs/lib/python3.11/site-packages/torch/autograd/__init__.py:266: UserWarning: c10d::broadcast_: an autograd kernel was not registered to the Autograd key(s) but we are trying to backprop through it. This may lead to silently incorrect behavior. This behavior is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of PyTorch. If your operator is differentiable, please ensure you have registered an autograd kernel to the correct Autograd key (e.g. DispatchKey::Autograd, DispatchKey::CompositeImplicitAutograd). If your operator is not differentiable, or to squash this warning and use the previous behavior, please register torch::CppFunction::makeFallthrough() to DispatchKey::Autograd. (Triggered internally at ../torch/csrc/autograd/autograd_not_implemented_fallback.cpp:63.)

torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 816.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 23.68 GiB of which 704.81 MiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 22.83 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 20.78 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 1.55 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
